    <h2>The history of the Great Wall of China</h2>
    
    <p id="paragraph">The Great Wall was continuously built from the 3rd century BC to the 17th century AD on the 
        northern border of the country as the great military defence project of successive Chinese 
        Empires, with a total length of more than 20,000 kilometers. The Great Wall begins in the 
        east at Shanhaiguan in Hebei province and ends at Jiayuguan in Gansu province to the west. 
        Its main body consists of walls, horse tracks, watch towers, and shelters on the wall, and
        includes fortresses and passes along the Wall. The Great Wall reflects collision and 
        exchanges between agricultural civilizations and nomadic civilizations in ancient China. 
        It provides significant physical evidence of the far-sighted political strategic thinking 
        and mighty military and national defence forces of central empires in ancient China, and 
        is an outstanding example of the superb military architecture, technology and art of ancient
        China. It embodies unparalleled significance as the national symbol for safeguarding the 
        security of the country and its people.For millennia, Chinese leaders instituted wall-building
        projects to protect the land from northern, nomadic invaders. One surviving section of such an
        ancient wall, in the Shandong province, is made of hard-packed soil called “rammed earth” and
        is estimated to be 2,500 years old. For centuries during the Warring States Period, before 
        China was unified into one nation, such walls defended the borders.Around 220 B.C.E., Qin 
        Shi Huang, also called the First Emperor, united China. He masterminded the process of 
        uniting the existing walls into one. At that time, rammed earth and wood made up most of 
        the wall. Emperor after emperor strengthened and extended the wall, often with the aim of
        keeping out the northern invaders. In some places, the wall was constructed of brick. 
        Elsewhere, quarried granite or even marble blocks were used. The wall was continuously 
        brought up to date as building techniques advanced.

    <h2>What we offer</h2>
   
    <p id="paragraph">We are offering a week long expedition to various sections of the Great wall. The expedition 
        will be lead by three professors who each specialise at different eras of chinese history and 
        how the different sections of the wall were built to solve the problems that affected the 
        Chinese at the time.
