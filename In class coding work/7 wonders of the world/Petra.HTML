    <h2>The history of Petra</h2>
    
    <p id="paragraph">Situated between the Red Sea and the Dead Sea and inhabited since prehistoric times, the rock-cut capital 
        city of the Nabateans, became during Hellenistic and Roman times a major caravan centre for the incense 
        of Arabia, the silks of China and the spices of India, a crossroads between Arabia, Egypt and Syria-Phoenicia
        .Petra is half-built, half-carved into the rock, and is surrounded by mountains riddled with passages 
        and gorges. An ingenious water management system allowed extensive settlement of an essentially arid area
        during the Nabataean, Roman and Byzantine periods. It is one of the world's richest and largest 
        archaeological sites set in a dominating red sandstone landscape. The Outstanding Universal Value of Petra
        resides in the vast extent of elaborate tomb and temple architecture; religious high places; the remnant 
        channels, tunnels and diversion dams that combined with a vast network of cisterns and reservoirs which
        controlled and conserved seasonal rains, and the extensive archaeological remains including of copper
        mining, temples, churches and other public buildings. The fusion of Hellenistic architectural facades
        with traditional Nabataean rock-cut temple/tombs including the Khasneh, the Urn Tomb, the Palace Tomb,
        the Corinthian Tomb and the Deir ("monastery") represents a unique artistic achievement and an 
        outstanding architectural ensemble of the first centuries BC to AD. The varied archaeological remains
        and architectural monuments from prehistoric times to the medieval periods bear exceptional testimony
        to the now lost civilisations which succeeded each other at the site.
