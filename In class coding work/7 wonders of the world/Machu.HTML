        <h2>The history of Machu Picchu</h2>
        
        <p>Embedded within a dramatic landscape at the meeting point between the Peruvian Andes and the Amazon Basin,
            the Historic Sanctuary of Machu Picchu is among the greatest artistic, architectural and land use achievements 
            anywhere and the most significant tangible legacy of the Inca civilization. Recognized for outstanding cultural
            and natural values, the mixed World Heritage property covers 32,592 hectares of mountain slopes, peaks and valleys
            surrounding its heart, the spectacular archaeological monument of “La Ciudadela” (the Citadel) at more than 
            2,400 meters above sea level. Built in the fifteenth century Machu Picchu was abandoned when the Inca Empire was 
            conquered by the Spaniards in the sixteenth century. It was not until 1911 that the archaeological complex was made 
            known to the outside world. The approximately 200 structures making up this outstanding religious, ceremonial, 
            astronomical and agricultural centre are set on a steep ridge, crisscrossed by stone terraces. Following a rigorous
            plan the city is divided into a lower and upper part, separating the farming from residential areas, with a large 
            square between the two. To this day, many of Machu Picchu’s mysteries remain unresolved, including the exact role 
            it may have played in the Incas’ sophisticated understanding of astronomy and domestication of wild plant species. 
            The massive yet refined architecture of Machu Picchu blends exceptionally well with the stunning natural environment,
            with which it is intricately linked. Numerous subsidiary centres, an extensive road and trail system, irrigation
            canals and agricultural terraces bear witness to longstanding, often on-going human use. The rugged topography making 
            some areas difficult to access has resulted in a mosaic of used areas and diverse natural habitats. The Eastern slopes
            of the tropical Andes with its enormous gradient from high altitude “Puna” grasslands and Polylepis thickets to montane
            cloud forests all the way down towards the tropical lowland forests are known to harbour a rich biodiversity and high
            endemism of global significance. Despite its small size the property contributes to conserving a very rich habitat and
            species diversity with remarkable endemic and relict flora and fauna.
