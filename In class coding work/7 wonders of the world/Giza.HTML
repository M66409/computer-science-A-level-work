    <h2>The history of the Pyramids</h2>
    
    <p id="paragraph"> The pyramids of Giza have been the center of the world's amazement for millenia as their visage towered
        above the surrounding delta. These symbols of power and opulence were used as the tombs for three 4th 
        dynasty rulers of Egypt. The Giza Pyramids, built to endure an eternity, have done just that. The monumental
        tombs are relics of Egypt's Old Kingdom era and were constructed some 4,500 years ago. Egypt's pharaohs expected
        to become gods in the afterlife. To prepare for the next world they erected temples to the gods and massive
        pyramid tombs for themselves—filled with all the things each ruler would need to guide and sustain himself 
        in the next world. Each of the three massive pyramids is but one part of a larger complex, including a palace,
        temples, solar boat pits, and other features. Pharaoh Khufu was the first Egyptian king to build a pyramid in 
        Giza, a project he began in circa 2550 B.C. His Great Pyramid is the largest in Giza and originally towered 
        some 481 feet (147 meters) above the plateau—it’s a bit shorter now with its smooth casing stones long gone. 
        Its estimated 2.3 million stone blocks each weigh an average of 2.5 to 15 tons. Khufu's son, Khafre, built 
        the second pyramid at Giza, circa 2520 B.C. His necropolis, or burial ground, stands out on the landscape
        because it also includes the Sphinx, a mysterious limestone monument with the body of a lion and the head of 
        a pharaoh. The Sphinx, which before the 1800s spent thousands of years buried in the sand with only its head 
        visible, may stand sentinel for the pharaoh’s tomb complex, although there’s no definitive proof that he built it.
        The third of the Giza Pyramids is considerably smaller than the first two—less than half their height at about 218 
        feet. Built by Khafre’s son Menkaure circa 2490 B.C. the pyramid’s elaborate complex includes two separate temples
        connected by a long causeway, and three individual queens’ pyramids. Menkaure’s chambers include niche decorations
        unique to Giza and a vaulted ceiling in his burial chamber itself. The pharaoh’s elaborate sarcophagus was lost at
        sea near Gibraltar in 1838.
